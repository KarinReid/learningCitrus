* Add Groovy Support?

## Additional functionality added
* fatjar - Gradle Shadow plugin required


## Running the tests
*

## Frameworks and dependencies
* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) - JDK & JRE.
* Citrus
* Cucumber(Citrus)
* Gradle
* [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/download.html) - Supports unit, functional, end-to-end, integration tests & annotations (including test order).


## Other tools used
* Postman - to explore the API

## Version Control

GIT, GitHub code repository - https://github.com/KarinReid/learningCitrus

## Evaluation - context dependent (I am fairly new to automation)
